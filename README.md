# Keppy's Notes Counter
This program allows you to add a MIDITrail's like counter to your videos, without the need of recording it through MIDITrail itself.

## Can I use your program's source code for my program?
Sure you can, but there are a few "rules" you need to follow.

What you can do:
- Take parts of the code, and use it on your apps. (As long as you credit me, BASS.NET and Un4seen.)
- Share the code on websites outside of the GitHub world. (Again, same as before.)
- Create ports of the simulator for other operating systems, such as Linux, Mac OS X, Amiga etc... Any other O.S. other than Windows. (See down below for further explanations.)

What you can't do:
- Clone the source code of the simulator, and change its name to "(Your name)'s Notes Counter". I mean, why would you do that?
- Create ports of the simulator in different programming languages, but with Windows support. There's already a Windows version, which is this one.

## Minimum system requirements for 1x rendering
- 1GHz CPU (Dual-core or single-core with HT/SMT)
- 1GB of RAM
- Windows Vista SP1 **(64-bit OSes ONLY)**

## How to install the QuickTime Components only
