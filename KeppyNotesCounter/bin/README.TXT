Instructions on how to use the counter generator:

1) Move FFMpeg in the main directory of the release you want to use. (If you want to use the x86 release, drag and drop FFMpeg in the x86 folder)
2) The counter uses QuickTime by default, so set your favorite codec by going to Settings > Change output resolution. You can also set the output resolution here.
3) Have fun.
